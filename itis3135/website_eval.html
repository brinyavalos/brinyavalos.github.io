<h3><a href="https://unseen.co/" class="web">Unseen Studio</a></h3>
<p class="good_bad">Unseen Studio has a great design according to C.R.A.P Principles. 
    They add quite a lot of visual interests with the way they incorporated images and the mouse to work together. 
    The website is very interactive as well.
    <ul class="crap">
        <li><strong class="letter">C</strong> -
            The website uses a dark background with white text, ensuring readability. 
            It also employs contrast in font size and weight to highlight important information.
        </li>
        <li><strong class="letter">R</strong> -
            Design elements like the navigation menu remain consistent across pages, 
            maintaining a cohesive user experience.
        </li>
        <li><strong class="letter">A</strong> - 
            Elements are well-aligned both horizontally and vertically,
             creating a clean layout and clear hierarchy of information.
        </li>
        <li><strong class="letter">P</strong> -
            Related elements are grouped closely together, enhancing 
            readability and allowing users to quickly locate information.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/" class="web">Craigslist</a></h3>
<p class="good_bad">Craigslist has a very bad design according to C.R.A.P Principles. 
    The design has many links cramped together in the center in right blue font.
    There is very little contrast in the overall colors that website is using. 
    <ul class="crap">
        <li><strong class="letter">C</strong> -
            The website lacks optimal contrast between text and background, impacting readability. 
            Design elements also lack contrast, leading to a uniform appearance.
        </li>
        <li><strong class="letter">R</strong> -
            While some layout structure repeats across listings, there's 
            inconsistency in design elements throughout different sections/pages.
        </li>
        <li><strong class="letter">A</strong> -
            Elements often lack consistent alignment, affecting visual appeal and readability.
        </li>
        <li><strong class="letter">P</strong> -
            Information can feel cluttered due to poor proximity between elements, making it difficult for users to quickly find what they need.
        </li>
