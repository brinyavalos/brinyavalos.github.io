                        Our project centered on enhancing user experience through a human-centered design approach. 
                        Beginning with needfinding, we analyzed user data to identify key challenges and develop clear design and usability goals. 
                        Using these insights, we crafted personas and designed different versions of the prototype, incorporating signifiers, affordances, metaphors, 
                        and modalities. Through heuristic evaluations, we refined the prototype based on given feedback, ensuring it complied with usability heuristics. 
                        Following in-person and virtual user testing sessions allowed us to gather direct feedback, and evaluate the prototype's effectiveness in meeting user needs and
                         achieving design objectives. Finally, by combining these findings from testing and evaluations, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation
                          of the prototype, refining it further for an optimized user experience.</p>

                    <p>This project, coded in Java, incorporates concepts learned from ITSC 1212 and 1213. Some included topics are exceptions, inheritance, file I/O, and arrayList. 
                        The objective of this project is to manage and retrieve existing accounts using either last name or account number as identifiers. It also enables the creation
                         of new accounts, deposits, withdraws, balance inquiries, and more. When the code is terminated, the system generates a comprehensive banking receipt as a file.
                        <br>
                        The code has essentially reached its final stages and successfully achieved its intended objective. However, 
                        there are areas that require attention in order to enhance the project's overall coherence.</p>
