                    <legend>Before University</legend>
                <p>I was born in Charlotte, but at the age of seven, my family and I moved to Monroe, NC. 
                    My first encounter with a technology focused course was in middle school through a robotics class. 
                    We programmed robots that we had built with partners to navigate obstacle courses marked with tape on the floor. 
                    I remember feeling thrilled about going to school because I knew we would be working with robots. Despite my initial excitement, 
                    I didn't pursue any more technology-related courses or consider it a potential career path after that class, simply because 
                    I wasn't aware that it could lead to a viable profession.

                <legend>How it started</legend>
                <p>After graduating high school, I enrolled in a community college to earn my associate degree.
                    It was there that I began exploring different potential majors, knowing that I wanted to continue my education. That's when I stumbled upon computer science. 
                    I have always been curious about how the things I use and see daily function, so the field immediately caught my interest. After discussing this with my advisor,
                     who confirmed it was a solid choice, I decided to apply to UNC Charlotte's computer science department.</p>

                    <legend>My Beginnings at University of North Carolina at Charlotte</legend>
                <p>Once I started at UNC Charlotte, taking my first computer science course confirmed my passion for the field.
                     I then took on a role as a preceptor for a course that served as an introduction to the computer science degree. 
                     This experience allowed me to assist first-year students as they began their college journey, which led me to pursue a teaching assistant position for the 
                     Intro to Computer Science II course the following semester. In this role, I helped students, mostly beginners, grasp complex Java coding concepts.

                <p>My educational journey has been marked by a growing understanding of what truly excites and inspires me. 
                    I particularly enjoyed a human-centered design course where I collaborated with a team on a project that prioritized user needs over the design team's convenience. 
                    This approach changed my perspective, encouraging me to always consider the "why" behind everything we create or engage with. These experiences have not only shaped my career 
                    path but have also motivated me to persist, now fully aware that I can build a fulfilling career around the things that bring me joy and empower me to make a difference.</p>
